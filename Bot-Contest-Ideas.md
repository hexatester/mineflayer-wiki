- Capture the Sheep
- Everyone is given a .schematic for some building, and their bot need to build it with no user intervention
- fastest to gather a block/all blocks
- Race to the nether : Everybody starts without anything. The goal is to get to the nether before everyone else. Two modes : challenge and competitive. In challenge, you play alone, in competitive, everyone is on the same map and may interact (killing or temporarely cooperating).
