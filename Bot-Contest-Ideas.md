## Capture the Sheep

## Schematic building
Everyone is given a .schematic for some building, and their bot needs to build it with no user intervention.

Different difficulty levels, like:
- "simple" blocks only
- fluids
- orientation-sensitive blocks
- mining out blocks that are air in the schematic

## Gather a block/all blocks

## Race to the nether
Everybody starts with an empty inventory and tries to get to the nether before everyone else.

Two modes:
- challenge: you play alone in the world
- competitive: everyone is on the same map and may interact (killing or temporarely cooperating)
