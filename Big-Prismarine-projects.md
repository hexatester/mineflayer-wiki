## AI
* one of the original goal of mineflayer, and still a very interesting usecase today was to make possible a bot that can solve the game, can we do this as part of https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer/issues/981 ?

## optimization
* protodef can be optimized up to 100x [PrismarineJS/node-minecraft-protocol#711](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/node-minecraft-protocol/issues/711) + having a compiler for the json format would unlock compiling into other languages too

## visualization
* displaying the world of the bot/server in a browser would be amazing [PrismarineJS/prismarine-world#17](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/prismarine-world/issues/17)
* related [#334](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer/issues/334)

## easier maintenance
* better procedure to update mcdata, see [PrismarineJS/minecraft-data#283](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/minecraft-data/issues/283)

## more protocol support
* bedrock is the future of minecraft, let's have support for it [PrismarineJS/node-minecraft-protocol#235](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/node-minecraft-protocol/issues/235)

## more doc => more users and less questions
* we need tutorials for mineflayer [#908](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer/issues/908) one form this could also take is a blog post / reddit posts to increase mineflayer popularity even more
